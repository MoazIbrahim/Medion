# Medion

Medion is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate various interactions and tasks for both teachers and students within the university ecosystem.
It serves as a centralized hub for academic activities, communication, and administrative functions.
Medion provides a user-friendly interface for teachers and students to manage their academic responsibilities efficiently.
Teachers can create and manage courses, upload assignments, grade submissions, communicate with students, and make announcements.
Students, on the other hand, can register for courses, view their schedules, submit assignments, interact with peers through messaging, and access important announcements from their teachers.
